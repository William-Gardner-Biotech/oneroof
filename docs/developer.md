## OneRoof Development Environment

Most `oneroof` development happens in the `dev` branch of this repo. To get started with doing so yourself, clone and switch to the `dev` branch like so:

    git clone https://github.com/nrminor/oneroof.git && \
    cd oneroof && \
    git checkout dev

From there, you‚Äôll have a few tools to consider installing if you haven‚Äôt already:

1.  The Pixi package manager, available here: <https://pixi.sh/latest/>
2.  The command runner Just, available here: <https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html>
3.  Pre-commit, available here: <https://pre-commit.com/>
4.  Docker to use the repo Dockerfile as a dev container, available here: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>
5.  Quarto to modify documentation, available here: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>
6.  An editor with language support for Nextflow (or Groovy as a fallback), Python, and Quarto (or Markdown as a fallback).

Most of this project was written in VSCode, as it‚Äôs currently the only editor with plugins for Nextflow, Quarto, and Python linters.

#### Pixi

Of these tools, Pixi is the only one that is essential, as it handles installing the pipeline‚Äôs dependencies from various `conda` registries as well as the Python Package Index. That said, you could even get away with not using `pixi` by manually installing the packages in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml) in a `conda` environment, using pip when needed.

If you are sticking with Pixi, run `pixi shell` in the project root before you get started. This will create a terminal environment with everything you need to work on and run `oneroof`.

#### Just

While Just isn‚Äôt as important as Pixi, I would still recommend installing it because of the conveniences it offers. With Just, the repo [`justfile`](../justfile) provides a switchboard of command shorthands, including:

- `just docs`, which runs a series of Quarto commands to render and bundle the repo docs (including this file) as well as construct an updated readme
- `just py`, which lints and formats all the repo‚Äôs Python files.
- `just docker`, which builds and pushes a new version of the repo Docker Image.
- `just env`, which instantiates the Pixi environment.
- `just all`, which does everything (`just doit` will do the same thingüòé).

Run `just` in the same directory as the repo [`justfile`](../justfile) to list all available recipes, and check out the [Just Programmer‚Äôs Manual](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_1.html) for more about Just.

#### Pre-commit

If you run `pre-commit install` in the repo root directory, it will install the pre-commit hooks in our [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../.pre-commit-config.yaml). These hooks make sure that formatting throughout the repo files are consistent before they can be committed. Again, not essential, but nice!

#### Docker

If you don‚Äôt want to futz with all of the above or with setting up Dorado locally, you can also use the Docker Hub image [`nrminor/dorado-and-friends:v0.1.0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nrminor/dorado-and-friends) as a dev container. It should every everything the pipeline and its dev environment needs, though its use as a dev container has not yet been tested.

#### Quarto

Quarto can be thought of as a renderer or compiler for documents written in supercharged Markdown. It can run code blocks, render to HTML, PDF, `reveal.js` presentations, websites, books, and dozens of other formats. As such, I use Quarto documents as the sort of ‚Äúur-format,‚Äù and render it out to other formats as desired. To render the project readme or other documents, you will need Quarto installed. The Quarto config file, [`_quarto.yml`](../_quarto.yml), controls project level settings, including a post-render section telling it to regenerate the Github-markdown-formatted readme from [`assets/index.qmd`](index.qmd) (via the project‚Äôs `just readme` recipe).
